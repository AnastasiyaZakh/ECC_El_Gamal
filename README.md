# ECC_El_Gamal

Implementation of El-Gamal signature on elliptic curves, cryptosystem of El-Gamal on EC, Lenstra factorization.

In "algorithms": 3 main files:
el_gamal, LENSTRA, signature

cipolla_y : 
solves x^2 = a (mod p) --> for x 

extended_euclid :
to find x^{-1} on field Z_{n} = {1, 2, 3, ..., n-1}
